    "# Plotting data\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several libraries for plotting data, the most popular probably being `matplotlib` and `bokeh`. The `matplotlib` library is inspired by Matlab's plotting tools and works quite well both for interactively exploring data and for creating finished plots for prints. The `bokeh` library creates graphs and visualizations in JavaScript, and is as such a great tool for creating plots that should be displayed on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both libraries work well together with the Jupyter Notebooks, and plots can be displayed and interacted with directly in the notebook. For `matplotlib` we should use a _notebook magic_ (a command starting with `%` that only works inside the notebook) to specify how `matplotlib`-plots should be handled. The typical values are `inline` which only includes the finished plot in the notebook, and `notebook` which creates an interactive plot in the notebook."
